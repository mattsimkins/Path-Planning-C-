# Path-Planning-C-
At the time of this writing, this project is a work in progress. A functional version, written in Python, is available in the Path-Planning-Python repo. This algorithm calculates paths based on training data. Applications include AGV, AAV, AUV, or robotic end effector paths. This version works for 2D cases. The 3D version isn't public.
