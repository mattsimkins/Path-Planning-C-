# Path-Planning-C++
At the time of this writing, this project is a work in progress. A more detailed README.md document is forthcomming as the project nears a more finished state. A functional version, written in Python, is available in the Path-Planning-Python repo. This algorithm calculates paths based on training data. Applications include AGV, AAV, AUV, or robotic end effector paths. This version works for 2D cases. The 3D version isn't public.

This algorith, now termed "All Rivers", is novel. At the time of this writting, it is under review with an academic journal.
